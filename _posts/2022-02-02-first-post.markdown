This is my first post! I'm not sure who you are reading this - probably someone I know, in which case this is utterly embarrassing. But nevermind that.

It has been on my mind to start a blog for a while. Actually, I have had multiple blogs in the past. My most recent blogging attempt was several years ago, as an eager first year student heading into a career in teaching. Being interested in education, I had intended to write on "learning about learning" (I know, real meta-nerdery). I have since decided that rather than teaching the next generation about physics, I ought to do something far less anxiety-inducing, like programming applications used by thousands of people. The stakes are still high, but at least my clients won't ask me difficult questions like "when am I ever going to need the pythagorean theorem anyway?"

As for what the blog content will include, I am not entirely sure. It's on my personal website rather than something like a substack because I'm not trying to do anything particularly consequential. But there will probably be some nerdery. (Sorry).
