    <h2> Projects </h2>

      <h3> cmd-f Hackathon </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What it was:</b> A 24-hour hackathon hosted by nwPlus on UBC Campus. My team's project was an Android app
        called ShareChore, a shared chore and task management app for roommates. The app was inspired by my personal experience -
        having lived with 5 other roommates in a 6-bedroom apartment during my second year, I had an intimate understanding of
        the complexities and frustrations of coordinating tasks and expenses in a household of roommates.</li>
        <li><b>Why I joined:</b> With one hackathon experience under my belt which I really enjoyed, I was itching to
          do another one. I also did not have a team prior to the hackathon, so I saw it as a chance to meet new people
          and take on a leadership role.</li>
        <li><b>What I did: </b>
          <ul> <li> Developed the front-end of the app using XML, Java, and Butterknife to implement the layout and buttons.</li>
               <li> Led the testing of the app by testing new features as they were added, and reporting any issues or bugs
                    back to the appropriate teammate.</li>
               <li> Identified and solved bugs from the portions of the code I contributed to by using the debugger as well as
                    commenting out code or writing print statements to chase down the locations of the bugs. </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


    <h2> Extracurricular Activites </h2>
      <h3>UBC C4 Choral Composition Club </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What it is:</b> A choir and composition club on UBC campus. We write our own original arrangements and compositions, rehearse
          weekly, and present our work every December and April at a concert.</li>
        <li><b>Why I joined:</b> In high school, I was heavily involved in music, participating in Concert Choir,
        Concert Band, Vocal Jazz, and Jazz Band. I joined C4 to continue to make music with others. I was drawn
        to the opportunity to learn how to compose and arrange choral music, and to join a smaller club so I could
        make a larger impact.</li>
        <li><b>What I did:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Directed and conducted choir pieces. Led warmups and ran rehearsals. </li>
            <li>Used Canva to create event posters and set up Facebook events for workshops and concerts.</li>
            <li>Planned, organized, and led two workshops on scat singing/ vocal jazz improvisation, aimed at beginners.</li>
            <li>Ran for and elected as President of club for 2019-2020 academic year.</li> </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pearson Press Club</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What it is:</b> My high school's student-run blog.</li>
        <li><b>Why I joined:</b> Growing up, I had always loved writing. I joined Pearson Press to gain confidence in
        sharing my writing with the world, as well as to contribute to my school community.</li>
        <li><b>What I did:</b>
          <ul>
            <li> 2014-2017: As a club member, I wrote articles on a variety of topics, including
