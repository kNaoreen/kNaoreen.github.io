        <h3> cmd-f Hackathon  //  March 2018</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>What it was:</b> A 24-hour hackathon hosted by nwPlus on UBC Campus. My team's project was an Android app
          called ShareChore, a shared chore and task management app for roommates. The app was inspired by my personal experience -
          having lived with 5 other roommates in a 6-bedroom apartment during my second year, I had an intimate understanding of
          the complexities and frustrations of coordinating tasks and expenses in a household of roommates.</li>
          <li><b>Why I joined:</b> With one hackathon experience under my belt which I really enjoyed, I was itching to
            do another one. I also did not have a team prior to the hackathon, so I saw it as a chance to meet new people
            and take on a leadership role.</li>
          <li><b>What I did: </b>
            <ul> <li> Developed the front-end of the app using XML, Java, and Butterknife to implement the layout and buttons.</li>
                 <li> Led the testing of the app by testing new features as they were added, and reporting any issues or bugs
                      back to the appropriate teammate.</li>
                 <li> Identified and solved bugs from the portions of the code I contributed to by using the debugger as well as
                      commenting out code or writing print statements to chase down the locations of the bugs. </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>MLH Local Hack Day Hackathon // December 2018</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>What is was:</b> A 12-hour hackathon held by nwPlus on UBC Campus. My team developed an Android app for
            visually impaired individuals. The user could hold their phone up to any object and press anywhere on the
            screen to take a picture. Using the Microsoft Azure object recognition API, the app would identify the object
            and produce audio describing what it is.</li>
          <li><b>Why I joined:</b> Prior to this experience, I had always been intimidated about participating in hackathons.
          However, I was very keen to learn new skills and develop a project with a team. I saw it as a chance to develop
          myself as a programmer and to challenge myself.</li>
          <li><b>What I did:</b>
            <ul>
              <li> Designed and developed front-end of app using XML and Java in Android Studio </li>
              <li> Implemented buttons in the user interface </li>
              <li> Implemented a toggleable night mode</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>CPSC 210 Course Project - Recipes App // September - December 2018</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>What is was:</b> A Java app for storing and viewing user-entered recipes.</li>
          <li><b>Motivation:</b> For years, I had been storing recipes by bookmarking their online links
          in a folder in Chrome. This would often lead to frustration, as most online recipe posts force you to
          scroll through lengthy introductory text and dozens of photos and ads before you get to the actual recipe.
          I wanted a simple, visually appealing app that would display only the most essential information in a recipe.</li>
          <li><b>What I did:</b>
            <ul>
              <li> Used JavaFX to develop the GUI of the app </li>
              <li> Used JUnit testing to test functions and classes </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>

        to the opportunity to learn how to compose and arrange choral music, and to join a smaller club so I could
