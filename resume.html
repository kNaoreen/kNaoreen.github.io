      <h3> cmd-f Hackathon </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>What it was:</b> A 24-hour hackathon hosted by nwPlus on UBC Campus. My team's project was an Android app
        called ShareChore, a shared chore and task management app for roommates. The app was inspired by my personal experience -
        having lived with 5 other roommates in a 6-bedroom apartment during my second year, I had an intimate understanding of
        the complexities and frustrations of coordinating tasks and expenses in a household of roommates.</li>
        <li><b>Why I joined:</b> With one hackathon experience under my belt which I really enjoyed, I was itching to
          do another one. I also did not have a team prior to the hackathon, so I saw it as a chance to meet new people
          and take on a leadership role.</li>
        <li><b>What I did: </b>
          <ul> <li> Developed the front-end of the app using XML, Java, and Butterknife to implement the layout and buttons.</li>
               <li> Led the testing of the app by testing new features as they were added, and reporting any issues or bugs
                    back to the appropriate teammate.</li>
               <li> Identified and solved bugs from the portions of the code I contributed to by using the debugger as well as
                    commenting out code or writing print statements to chase down the locations of the bugs. </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


    <h2> Extracurricular Activites </h2>
      <h3>UBC C4 Choral Composition Club </h3>
      <li><b>What it is:</b> A choir and composition club on UBC campus. We write our own original arrangements and compositions, rehearse
        weekly, and present our work every December and April at a concert.</li>
      <li><b>Why I joined:</b>
